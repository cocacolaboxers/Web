        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A young woman named Emily Thorne comes to the Hamptons and rents a beach house 
            next door to the mansion of a wealthy family, the Graysons. Emily is actually Amanda Clarke, 
            whose father was framed by the Graysons for treason when she was a little girl, and the beach house 
            is her childhood home. After a lengthy trial, he was imprisoned for life and was murdered in prison 
            by associates of the people who framed him. Meanwhile, Amanda was separated from him and spent most 
            of her time in a juvenile correctional facility, only to find out her father was killed six weeks 
            before she was released on her 18th birthday. She now returns to the Hamptons as an adult to get 
            revenge on those who wronged her father and her. Her primary target is Victoria Grayson, matriarch 
            of the Grayson family, who loved and betrayed Amanda's father. 
            The show focuses on Emily's plot to destroy every individual who played a role in her father's 
            imprisonment. Along the way, she discovers various facts about her father's past which changes her 
            plans many times. As the series progresses, Emily brings in other individuals as allies for her plan.
            <br>
            <br>
            As Emily executes the stages of her elaborate plan, she finds remaining emotionally detached to be difficult. 
            She struggles to identify her true motivations and examines how her actions change her sense of identity. 
            As she enlists trusted friends into her schemes, she worries how their involvement will change their lives 
            and how she will proceed after she exacts her revenge on those who wronged her father and her.

            <h4><i>Portrayed by Emily VanCamp</i></h4>
            <p>
                Emily Thorne has been described as a flawed and multifaceted heroine figure. 
                Due to her father being betrayed and her being forced into foster care and juvenile detention, 
                Thorne has become emotionally troubled. The character usually appears calm and cold while dealing with 
                difficult circumstances but as the series progresses, 
                she begins to reveal vulnerabilities in her demeanor and reacts more emotionally to situations, 
                which also impedes her efforts to get vengeance.

                Charlotte is the youngest daughter in both the Grayson and Clarke families. 
                The legal daughter of Conrad and Victoria Grayson, Charlotte is actually the result of her
